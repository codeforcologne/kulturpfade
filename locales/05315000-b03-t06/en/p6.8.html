    Until the construction of the Esso hotel, the stately classicist country house Kitschburg stood in its place, which was built in 1814/15 and later served as a city forest restaurant. The agricultural complex of the Kitschburg also included the small farm Dürener Straße 285, whose baroque residential building was built in 1759. As a last relic, it reminds us that less than 100 years ago, the entire surrounding area had been used for agriculture.
