    The bright hall building over a rectangular floor structure was built in 1954 by Rudolf Schwarz and Josef Bernard. The decisive design element is the concrete construction, whose intermediate fields are filled with bricks and glass. The diamond as the basic form of the wall solution conditioned transverse roofs and a folding ceiling inside. The new glass windows by Georg Meistermann change the church space originally intended as a sober hall. The enthroned Madonna comes from Kurt Zimmermann. From an architectural point of view, the church represents a consistent further development of the "Bauhaus thought" in the forms of the 50s.
