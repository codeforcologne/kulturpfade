<p>
    The manufacturer's villa, which entered the history of architecture as Haus Max Mejrowsky (Fürst-Pückler-Straße 48), is one of the most important Cologne buildings of the time before the First World War. It was built in 1910 by Ludwig Bopp as a total work of art. Peter Behrens, Fritz Schumacher, Fritz Erler, Georg Wrba and Otto Gussmann participated in the interior design. The outer plastic comes from Georg Wrba. Before the war, the house had a high gable structure and four corner towers.
