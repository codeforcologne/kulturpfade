Braunsfeld was born in the 19th Century founded by Ferdinand Braun, who owned a brick field here. In Braunstraße, some houses have still been preserved from the first development. From about 1900, mainly villas were built in this former workers' suburb, which gave Braunsfeld the character of an elegant residential area. Lindenthal is also quite young. It was founded in 1846 by the Cologne citizens Thelen and Fühling and already in the 19th century. Century expanded into a villa suburb. The construction of noble residential buildings was particularly favoured by the creation of the city forest in the years 1895-98. Today, Lindenthal also includes the former villages of Kriel, Lind, Hohenlind, Deckstein and Melaten.
