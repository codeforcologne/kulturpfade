                The cultural paths Cologne were developed at the end of the 1970s. They should raise awareness of the protection of monuments in post-war Cologne. In the cityscape, they were represented by information boards, which were mostly installed on buildings. They told the building and settlement history aspects of the respective building with an overview of neighboring points of the same cultural path.
            </p><p>
                The information boards were last partially renewed at the beginning of the 2010s at the instigation of district associations. Although there were some publications on the cultural paths, the knowledge about them is only fragmentary.
            </p><p>
                As part of an open data project of the OK Lab Cologne and the city of Cologne, still existing sources are initially researched and an application is being developed that should make knowledge accessible again and offers the opportunity to open up further cultural paths.
