    The elongated brick-clad complex of the hospital was built in 1930-32 according to designs by Hans Tietmann and Karl Haake. Integrated into the construction is the hospital church built at the same time by Dominikus Böhm, a flat ceiling hall with raised altar room and galleries for the sick. The apse was paised in 1949/50 by Peter Hecker. In the chapels under the galleries mosaics by Ludwig Baur (1934); the man of pain was created by Ewald Mataré in 1937. The hospital complex is one of the most important examples of early modern architecture in Cologne.
