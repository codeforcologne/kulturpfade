<p>
    The Heiligenhäuschen, designed like a miniature chapel on the corner of Dürener Straße/Dorfstraße was built at the beginning of the 19th century. Built in the 19th century instead of a chapel built in 1690. The founder of this chapel, which was destroyed in Napoleonic times, was the Felten couple, tenants of the nearby Platzhof. Due to a traffic accident in 1959, the Heiligenhäuschen was so damaged that it had to be rebuilt according to the old model.
