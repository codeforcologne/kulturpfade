    In the street Am Morsdorfer Hof, a remarkable villa and residential building development was built in the 20s and 30s on the site of the Morsdorfer Hof, which was demolished in 1929. The famous House of Riphahn from 1923/24 (No. 10) also stood here until the war. Also by Wilhelm Riphahn the partially preserved house No. 26 from 1925. An excellent example of "new construction" is the former private house of the architect Dondorff (No. 26a).
