    The city forest was created as the first spacious park with a largely "forest-like" character by decision of the Cologne City Council (1895) on the edge of the growing big city. The basis for this was the one from the early 19th century. Century Kitschburg, a water castle-like country estate of the Cologne banker family Schaaffhausen. With the inclusion of the park created around the former country house by the DÃ¼sseldorter court gardener Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe, the city forest was created in 1895-1898, according to the Cologne garden director Adolf Kowallek. This volkspark-like facility with waters, meadows, forest parts and sports fields could be expanded for the first time in 1910 and 1919 in connection with the planning of the outer green belt in an out-of-city direction.
