<p>
    Pauliplatz, named after the court and landowner Josef Pauli, was created in 1914 on the lands of the former Maarhof. The space structure, which avoids all symmetry, is framed by romantically grouped houses, the youngest of which date from the early 1920s. The houses date from 1914 Paulistraße 38-44, a residential group kept in the home style of the time around the First World War with gables, old windows, lattice windows and an upstream fountain. This place was recommended to visitors to the Kölner Werkbundausstellung 1914 as an exemplary example.
