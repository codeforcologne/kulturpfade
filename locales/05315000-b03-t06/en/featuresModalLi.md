# Features

*   The overview shows the way and the number of sights along a route. The course of the path corresponds in the best possible way to the original route of the cultural path.
*   The map view shows details along the path. The sights are indicated by red markers with their numbers.
*   A modal dialogue shows information about the sights. The texts are taken from the booklets published for the cultural paths. A photo illustrates the entry.
*   The route is calculated with a routing system developed for this project. This makes it possible to display not only the length of the route, but also the time required.
*   The information in the dialogue on the sights contains the reference to the source. Further information is linked.
*   Each cultural path is preceded by a text that emphasizes the special features of the route. These texts can be found in the menu item 'About'.
*   Different languages can be displayed. Proper names are not translated. Each additional language is associated with additional editorial effort.
*   The Locate Tool makes it possible to transmit the location to the browser. The current position is displayed as a blue dot on the map.
*   By calling up the page, all data is transferred to the browser. The processing takes place on the smartphone. No data about persons, their usage behavior or their position is collected or stored.
*   Each cultural trail has its own side. The paths of the district can be found via the menu item 'About/ Links'.
*   The page 'About the project' describes the connections. Here it is possible to contact the development team.
