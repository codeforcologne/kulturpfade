    The eaves-ended brick building is the manor house of the former Petershof, which is also called Marienhof in previous documents. Probably as early as 1262, this court came into the possession of the Monastery of St. Apostles through a gift. As a Fronhof and courthouse, he was of great importance. The late Baroque mansion dates from 1792. The court secularised in Napoleonic times later became private property. After the construction of the new building at Belvederestraße 17, the Marienhof lost its original function in 1896
