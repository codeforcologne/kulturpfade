    It was not until around 1900 that the expansion of Vitalisstraße, which until then was called Müngersdorfer Weg, began. In 1902/03, the city of Cologne built the so-called "gas houses" (Vitalisstraße 330-362) here for the workers and employees of the Ehrenfelder Gaswerke. It is a two-storey semi-detached housing estate with plaster facades and a division in brick and half-timbered. The architect was Peter Gärtner. The settlement is one of the few almost completely preserved examples of the workers' housing construction of the turn of the century in Cologne. The remaining houses in Vitalisstraße are largely cooperative workers' housing construction from the first quarter of the 20th century. Century.
