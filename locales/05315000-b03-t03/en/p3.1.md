Until 1888, the monastery of St. Apostles at the beginning of the 13th century stood in the same place. Former parish church founded in the 19th century. In 1889/90, the current church was built by the architect Theodor Kremer as a neuro-Romanic brick basilica. In its architectural design language, the church corresponds to the Rhenish Romanesque of the Middle Ages; essentially, only the proportions and the view of the interior have changed. The interior was recast by the architect Rudolf Schwarz in 1960. The designs of the windows come from Wilhelm Bauschulte. Hildegard Domizlaff made tabernacle, lecture cross and altar candlestick. Next to the church is the rectory, which was reached in 1880 as a brick building
