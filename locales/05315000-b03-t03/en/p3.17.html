    Until the middle of the 19th. In the 19th century, the farm was called Hermannshof. Documents mention a Hermann von Herrmannshoven in 1418. In 1581, the court is named in the register of the Cologne Apostles's monastery. Around 1860, Heinrich Hartzheim becomes the new owner, who has the entire complex completely re- built a few years later. The closed courtyard, built in the Franconian tradition, today marks the eastern edge of the former village of Müngersdorf in an environment of new buildings.
