The closed courtyard complex reached in brick was built in 1896 as the successor to the older Petershof (Wendelinstraße 67). At the beginning of the 20th Century, the Cologne banker Ernst Koenigs was the owner. Count Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden lived there for several years, government president in Cologne from 1922-1926. Since 1926, the court has belonged to the city of Cologne and has housed a municipal daycare centre since 1945. For a long time, there were workshops of the Green Space Office in the economic buildings.
