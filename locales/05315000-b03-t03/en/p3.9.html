    On this corner plot, the architect Oswald Mathias Ungers (1926 to 2007) built his residential building with two separate apartments and an office in 1958/59. With the use of exposed concrete and clinker in the cubically interlocking buildings, the building represented the beginning of a new architectural language in Germany. The library cube from basalt lava has been joining Quadrather Straße since 1990. The "Ungers Archive for Architectural Science (UAA)" is located here. Both buildings are under monument protection.
