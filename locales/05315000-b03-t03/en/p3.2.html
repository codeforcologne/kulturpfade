    From 1261 to 1803, the church courtyard was one of the possessions of the Cistercian Abbey of Altenberg. At that time, generous lands enrounged the estate. A document of 1608 quantifies the agricultural area of the farm with a total of 162 acres of land, which was later claimed for settlement purposes and in the construction of the Müngersdorf stadium. Today's closed courtyard comes from the 18th and 19th centuries. Century. The manor house with a roof, the interior of which is preserved almost unchanged, dates from 1774. After secularisation (1803), the farm came into private ownership.
