    Wilhelm Riphahn built this striking residential building in 1951/52 in the Bauhaus style of the 1920s for the important Cologne lawyer and art collector Josef Haubrich (1889 to 1961). In the three-storey tower is the private living area; the one-storey round building was designed as a large living space and in particular for the presentation of Haubrich's painting collection. Wilhelm Riphahn also designed the residential and studio house for Gerhard Marcks (No. 13 of this cultural path).
