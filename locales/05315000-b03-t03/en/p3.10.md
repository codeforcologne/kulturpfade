In 1994 to 1996, Oswald Mathias Ungers built his last residential building here as an architectural manifesto, the clear concept of which goes back to Palladio and Schinkel, among others. The rules of proportions and numbers determine the design, which is characterized by objectlessness and renunciation of narrative elements and materials. The naming alluded to Robert Musil's novel title characterizes the homogeneity of all elements and accesses. In the garden, the basic structure of the building is repeated. Today, the house is the headquarters of the Dr. Speck Literature Foundation.
