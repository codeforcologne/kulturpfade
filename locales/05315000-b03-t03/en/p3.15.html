    Müngersdorf already owned in the 19th. Century in changing places in the village school building. In 1904/05, due to a steadily increasing number of pupils, the construction of the new school in Wendelinstraße became necessary. The school building itself is strongly based on the "romantically" late-medial castle construction in its architecture, the staggering of buildings. Like a castle, this school still asserts itself today in the panorama of the village.
