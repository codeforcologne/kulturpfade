<p>
    The architect Theodor Edwin Merrill built this residential building with two studios in 1929 for the sculptor Hildegard Domizlaff (1898 to 1987) and the painter Helen Wiehen. It was the first building in the upper Belvederestraße and the first of the so-called "artist's houses". Designed in the style of "New Building", it reflects the self-image of the clients as avant-garde artists. Hildegard Domizlaff lived and worked here until her death. The advanced aesthetics of the building, the social backgrounds of its time of origin and the personality of Hildegard Domizlaff give the house an outstanding importance.
