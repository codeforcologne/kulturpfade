On the site of the intermediate plant Va of the former Prussian fortress ring (built in 1875 - 1876), which Lord Mayor Konrad Adenauer had expanded into an outer green belt in the 1920s, the Municipal Outdoor and Gardening School (Freiluga) was created in 1925 on the initiative of the City School Councilor Fritz Schu. At this extracurricular learning place, nature is the center of school work. The large terrain with meadows, forest and garden is at the same time a place of learning and the object of learning.
