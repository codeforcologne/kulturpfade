    After the incorporation of Müngersdorf into Cologne in 1888, the transformation of the village into a popular place of residence began for citizens of the middle class, often civil servants and employees, later also artists. In the immediate vicinity of small residential buildings and large courtyard complexes were built at the beginning of the 20th century. Century the houses Belvederestraße 20, 22, and 24, but also other city villas in the old town center. They illustrate the process of urbanization with the changes in housing construction at the time. The ensemble gives a good impression of the zeitgeist.
