# What to expect

Sülz and Klettenberg as well as the area around the university in Lindenthal are to be explored through tour 4 of the cultural path.

That Sülz until the 19th. Century consisted almost only of agricultural land and zahi-rich farms, is hardly comprehensible today. Only the White House is the only preserved farmyard that reminds this. The modern development of the suburb does not begin until 1845 with the construction of workers' houses in the area between Marsiliusstraße and Sülzgürtel. In addition to this first development, which is practised by small businesses, the residential districts of the time shortly after 1900 and the 1920s are characterised by the district. Klettenberg was created shortly after the turn of the century as a pure residential district. The core area is located around the Siebengebirgsallee. In the 1920s, numerous settlement buildings were built here and single-family houses around the Klettenbergpark. Characteristic of the district is particularly the strong greening with avenues, squares and front gardens, which can hardly be found in Cologne today.
