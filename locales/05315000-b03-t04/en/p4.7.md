In 1960-62, the Franciscan simple-looking brick building of the Catholic parish church of St. Laurentius (An St. Laurentius 1) was built. The design is by Emil Steffan. Symbolically, the interior of the church built on a square floor pand is dominated by a circular crown of lights with 24 lamps. The foundation stone with St. Laurentius on the grate was designed by Jochen Pechau. The parish centre with an atmospheric fountain court is adjoining the church on the narrowest floor pane.
