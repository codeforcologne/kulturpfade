    The expansion of Sülz as a suburb only began in the 19th century. Century by the intensive creation of brickworks and gravel pits. For the population working here, the contractor Heinrich Wagner built the first residential buildings, small gable and eave brick buildings in 1845. From this early period, particularly many examples have been preserved in Redwitzstraße (No. 57-83).
