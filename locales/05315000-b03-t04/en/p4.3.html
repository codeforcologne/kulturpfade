    The 1925/26 according to plans of the Mainz Cathedral Builder Prof. Becker built Catholic parish church was rebuilt after significant war destruction. Among other things, the pulpit is still preserved from the original expressionist interior design of the architect Hans Hansen. The altar cross comes from Hanns Rheindorf, the stained glass in the crypt of J. Berwanger. In 1967 and 1972, Elmar Hillebrand created the marble sculptures on the staircase (Jacob's struggle with the angels of God and the good shepherd in the thorn scrub of human existence). Opposite the church, a remarkable apartment block built in 1928/29 by Ernst Scheidt in brick. The client was the non-profit housing cooperative at the Vorgebirgspark e.G.m.b.H.
