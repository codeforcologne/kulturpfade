    Shortly after 1900, the Klettenberg district was created based on the urban development concept of Carl Rehorst. In contrast to the Cologne Neustadt, the streets are curved and laid out without any axiality, an influence of the important city planner Camillo Sitte. Also characterised is a strong greening with front gardens and avenues. A particularly closed picture conveys above all the Siebengebirgsallee, the main development street of the district, which with its magnificent town houses reminds of the most destroyed Gründerzeit district of Cologne.
