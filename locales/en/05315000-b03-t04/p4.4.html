    At about the same place where a St. Nicholas chapel is already attested for 1201, the Catholic parish church of St. Nicholas was built in 1906-09 according to designs by Franz Statz. The three-nave basilica Querhaus and a 53 m high main tower follows the mediaeval Rhenish Romanesque in its forms. During the last restoration in 1977/78, a mediaeval appearance was taken into account in the interior. The apse of 1919 came from Johannes Osten. The design of the altar niches, 1960, was in the hands of Peter Hecker. Choir and transer windows, 1960, by Heinrich Windelschmidt; the Obergaden windows from the 1970s by Paul Weigmann.
