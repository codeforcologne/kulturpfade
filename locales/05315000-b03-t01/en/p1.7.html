<p> Due to the strong expansion of Weiden, which was supervised by Lövenich,
the construction of a first parish church had become necessary in 1927. The
design for this church was provided by the architects Böll & Neuhaus.
Stylistically, the church is one of the few sacred examples of expressionist
architecture in Cologne. </p>
