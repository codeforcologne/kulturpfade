<p> Construction of the first parish church in Weiden became necessary in 1927
due to the rapid expansion of the town, which was ecclesiastically served by
Lövenich. The design for this church was provided by the architects Böll &amp;
Neuhaus. Stylistically, the church is one of the few examples of Expressionist
church architecture in Cologne. </p>
