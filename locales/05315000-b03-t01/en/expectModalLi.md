# What to expect

Tour 1 of the <i>Kulturpfade</i>, starting from the Müngersdorfer
Stadium, leads through the western suburbs of Cologne, which were
only incorporated in 1975, and have, in parts, retained their rural
character. Junkersdorf, first documented as "Gunterersthorp" in
962, is still centered around the <i>Statthalterhof</i> (governor's
court) and the old village church. In the Middle Ages, the Cologne
Antonites owned the "Herlichkeit" Junkersdorf. The expansion of the
village as "garden city" began in the late 1920s with the
construction of respresentative single-family homes. Weiden, now
dominated by high-rise buildings in its center, was originally an
insignificant roadside settlement. From 1906, it was developed as a
villa colony which has largely been preserved in the area around
Emil-Schreiterer-Platz. The once independent village of Üsdorf also
belongs to Weiden. The town of Lövenich was first documented around
1000 along with the church of St. Severin. Since the 2nd half of
the 14th century it has been owned by the Order of St. John along
with the largest farms. Despite numerous newly developed
residential areas, Lövenich has to this day been able to maintain
the air of a village characterized by farmyards. Almost completely
intact, Widdersdorf has the character of a village in the
surrounding area of Cologne. Numerous farmsteads and small older
houses are grouped around the church. as smaller old houses are
grouped. It was first documented as "Wichenthorpe" in 1136.
