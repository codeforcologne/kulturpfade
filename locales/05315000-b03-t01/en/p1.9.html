<p> From the 14th to the early 19th In the 19th century, the Mertenshof was
owned by the Cologne Johanniter-Kommende St. Johann and Cordula. The current
building dates back to 1848 in its oldest parts. Due to its immediate
neighbourhood to the church, the large closed courtyard complex has an enormous
urban significance, which has a formative effect on the still rural centre of
Lövenich. </p>
