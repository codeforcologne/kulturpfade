    Around 1860, the now existing facility of the Keuschhof was built. First documentary mentions date back to the year 1377. At that time, referred to as the Spiegelhof, the farm of Matthias von Spiegel von Irrgang was sold to the Johanniter-Ritter von Braunsberg. The Hofgut, designed according to Franconian construction, offers an imposing impression, especially due to the exposed location of its late-classical mansion, which is oriented towards Weiden with its main front. Since 1983, the farm has been used as a hotel, among other things.
