<p> The current structure of the Keuschhof was constructed around 1860. The
first references date back to 1377, when the estate, known at the
time as Spiegelhof, was sold by Matthias von Spiegel von Irrgang to the
Johanniter Knight of Braunsberg. The manor, built in the Frankish style, makes
an imposing impression due to the prominent location of its late-classicist
manor house facing Weiden. Since 1983, the estate has been used as a hotel.
