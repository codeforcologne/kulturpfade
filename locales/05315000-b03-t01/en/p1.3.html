<p> The old village church lies on a slight hill in the center of Junkersdorf
surrounded by the village cemetary. Today the building serves as a
Kindergarten. First documented in 1223, it is assumed that a church already
existed here in 898. In 1324, the church was incorporated into the Cologne
<i>Gereonsstift</i> (Gereon Monastary). In 1676, a fire caused extensive damage
to the interior. A further fire in 1754 left only the church's choir standing.
During reconstruction the west tower was added to the church. The church was
extended into a basilica, in the middle of the 19th century.</p>
