<p> The first known documentary mention of the Üsdorfer Kapelle dates back to
1466 and names Cologne's <i>Mariengradenstift</i> (St. Maria ad Gradus
Endowment) as its owner. After being destroyed, the chapel was rebuilt in 1669
as a simple hall building. Until the 1960s, the church, dedicated to St.
Stephen, was integrated into the complex of the now demolished Engelshof. It is
planned to incorporate the chapel into a new development and return it to its
original use. </p>
