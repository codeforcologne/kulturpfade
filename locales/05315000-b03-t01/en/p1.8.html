<p> An inscription above the gate states the courtyard was restored in 1768 by
<i>Komtur MHE. Detils</i>. Tradition holds the property was a fiefdom
<i>Lehenshof</i> of the Brauweiler Abbey. It is possible, but unconfirmed by
documentation, that the Johanniter-Komturei of Cologne was the owner of the
estate until secularization. The very impressive, enclosed complex of the
Odemshof is one of the large estates of Lövenich. The broadly laid-out late
baroque manor house with its curved gables is unique in Cologne. In front of
the estate's entrance is a wayside cross from 1862, commemorating the former
tenants Krosch-Lemper.</p>
