<p> The castle courtyard is first mentioned in documents in 1396 as
"borchgraven hoff" (Burggrafenhof). In that year, it was sold by Heinrich von
der Heiden to the Cologne Abbey of St. Maria in the Capitol. With great
probability, the original owners (probably until the 13th Century) the Counts
of Aremberg. the bearers of the Burggrave title. The current complex of the
court dates largely from around 1860. The castle courtyard, built in Franconian
construction, is characterised by its size and location near the church and
directly at the entrance to the village of Widdersdorf. </p>
