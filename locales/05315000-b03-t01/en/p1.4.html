<p> According to ancient tradition, the Fronhof was a gift from Empress Helena
in 345 A.D. In 1330, the Cologne Gereonsstift was first mentioned as the
owner. Throughout the Middle Ages, the estate also served as seat of the court.
An inscription dates the mighty baroque complex, which follows the Frankish
building style, to the year 1718.</p>

The chapel opposite the main entrance, with its original furnishings, also
dates from the 18th century, forming a unique ensemble together with the
estate.
