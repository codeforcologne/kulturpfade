<p> Up until a few years ago, the Mertenshof was in a nearly ruinous state. It
was converted into a residential complex by architect Oswald Matthias
Ungers ca. 1980 in collaboration with monument preservation authorities. The
building substance, dating to around 1860, and the overall impression of the
site were carefully preserved during the conversion. The estate, located in the
immediate vicinity of the church, was probably owned by the Cologne Convent of
St. Gertrud Dominican nuns in the Middle Ages. </p>
