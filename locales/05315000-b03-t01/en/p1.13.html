<p> Just a few years ago, the Mertenshof was in an almost ruinous condition. In
cooperation with the preservation of monuments, it was converted into a
residential complex around 1980 by the architect Oswald Matthias Ungers. During
the conversion, attention was paid to the extensive preservation of the
building fabric from around 1860 as well as the overall impression. The
courtyard, located in the immediate vicinity of the church, was probably owned
by the Cologne Domi- nican convent St. Gertrud in the Middle Ages. </p>
