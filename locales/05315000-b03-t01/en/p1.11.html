<p> Only the western parts of the 12th century Romanesque core structure are
still preserved. In 1857/58, the Frechen master builder Ernst (?) Weyden
constructed the eastern section on the old choir foundations, following plans
by Ernst Friedrich Zwirner. Inside, remnants of historical painting are
preserved. Thorough renovation work was carried out in 1979/80.</p>
