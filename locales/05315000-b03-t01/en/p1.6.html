<p>This Roman family tomb, discovered in 1843, belonged to an as-yet
undiscovered estate. It is one of the most elaborate burial sites in the
Gallic-Germanic provinces known to date. The burial chamber, originally likely
two stories high, was built in the middle of the 2nd century AD. The structure,
dug into the ground and constructed of tuff blocks with a sandstone portal, is
internally divided by niches on three sides. The original furnishings have been
preserved: three marble busts (late 2nd century) and two wicker chairs
replicated in limestone. The seasonal sarcophagus
(<i>Jahreszeitensarkophag</i>) (end of the 3rd century) once stood outside the
chamber. In 1844, the superstructure and the guardhouse were constructed
according to plans of Cologne Cathedral master builder Ernst Friedrich
Zwirner.</p>
