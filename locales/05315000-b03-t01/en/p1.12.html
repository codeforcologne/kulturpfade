<p> This farmstead was novel construction in 1862, with no medieval predecessor
unlike the other estates in Lövenich. L.Zaun was responsible for building the
enclosed estate, constructed in Frankish style. He gave the estate a Hungarian
name reminiscent of his hunting exhibitions in the Carpathian Mountains.
Stylistically, the late classicist manor house, with its strict axial division
and emphasized central gable, is similar to many manor houses in the Cologne
area. A further farmstead in Freimersdorf, formerly owned by the Zaun family,
is almost identical to Haus Közal. </p>
