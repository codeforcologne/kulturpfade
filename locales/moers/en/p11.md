The Jewish community in Moers was first mentioned in 1613 and faced legal and occupational restrictions until the 19th century; full emancipation was only achieved in 1869. In 1928, approximately 230 Jews lived in Moers, considering themselves Germans of Jewish faith, but they were subjected to antisemitic attacks even before 1933, such as the desecration of the Jewish cemetery in 1927. After the National Socialists seized power, their situation deteriorated drastically due to discriminatory laws and harassment, forcing many to emigrate; the Reich Pogrom Night in 1938 prompted further escapes. The remaining 60 Jews were crammed into five so-called “Jewish houses” and, starting in 1941, deported in three transports to Riga and Theresienstadt; in total, at least 180 members of the Moers synagogue community were murdered.
