The Evangelical City Church in Moers dates back to a chapel founded in 1363 by Count Dietrich VI, which was later expanded into a Carmelite monastery. After the Reformation, the monastery was dissolved in 1573, and the church was used by the Protestant congregation. The neo-Gothic tower was built between 1889 and 1891, modeled after the Christ Church in Bochum. Inside, frescoes from the first half of the 15th century have been preserved, and archaeological studies confirm that the interior was used as a burial site, particularly for wealthy Moers families.
