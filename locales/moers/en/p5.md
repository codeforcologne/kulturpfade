After the introduction of the Reformation in 1560, only a few Catholics lived in Moers until the early 18th century, mainly garrison members and some immigrants. With the influx of former French soldiers, craftsmen, and laborers during the Seven Years’ War, the Catholic community grew to about 50 members. In 1771, King Frederick II permitted a collection for the construction of a Catholic church, whose foundation stone was laid in 1778 and consecrated a year later; today, this early classical building serves as a kindergarten. Due to the growth of the congregation, the present Catholic parish church of St. Josef was built between 1868 and 1871, a three-nave neo-Gothic brick basilica with a three-apse termination and west tower.
