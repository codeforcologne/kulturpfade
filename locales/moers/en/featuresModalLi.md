*   The overview shows the way and the number of sights along a route.

*   The route is calculated with a routing system developed for this project. This makes it possible to display not only the length of the route, but also the time required.

*   Each cultural path is preceded by a text that emphasizes the special features of the route. These texts can be found in the menu item 'About'.
