The old village church lies on a slight hill in the center of Junkersdorf surrounded by the village cemetary. Today the building serves as a Kindergarten. First documented in 1223, it is assumed that a church already existed here in 898. In 1324, the church was incorporated into the Cologne _Gereonsstift_ (Gereon Monastary). In 1676, a fire caused extensive damage to the interior. A further fire in 1754 left only the church's choir standing. During reconstruction the west tower was added to the church. The church was extended into a basilica, in the middle of the 19th century.
