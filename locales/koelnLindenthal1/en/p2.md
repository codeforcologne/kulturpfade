Of the formerly free-standing closed courtyard of the Statthalterhof, only the baroque manor house of 1785 and the part of a wing building are preserved. Medieval sources mention the court, among others, TÃ¶nneshof, villa dominicata and Sterrenhof. The earliest documentary mention, in which the Cologne patrician family Scherffgen is mentioned as the owner, dates from 1260. However, the farm itself is likely to be much older. It was probably built on the first center of Junkersdorf, which was destroyed in the Norman confusion (881/882). The Statthalterhof was probably also the founding place for the medieval "glory Junkersdorf", because in 1425 the Cologne Antoniters become the lords of this glory by buying the court.
