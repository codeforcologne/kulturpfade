![Burghof (Widdersdorf)](./images/koelnLindenthal1/p15.jpg)

The Burghof was first mentioned in documents as “borchgraven hoff” (Burggrafenhof) in 1396. It was sold by Heinrich von der Heiden to the Cologne monastery of St. Maria im Kapitol in that year. The original owners (probably until the 13th century) were most likely the Counts of Aremberg, who held the title of Burgraf. The current structures of the farmyard stem mostly from around 1860. Due to it's Franish style, size and proximity to the church, immediately at the entrace of the village, the Burghof is characteristic of the Widdersdorf townscape.
