This farmstead was novel construction in 1862, with no medieval predecessor unlike the other estates in Lövenich. L.Zaun was responsible for building the enclosed estate, constructed in Frankish style. He gave the estate a Hungarian name reminiscent of his hunting exhibitions in the Carpathian Mountains. Stylistically, the late classicist manor house, with its strict axial division and emphasized central gable, is similar to many manor houses in the Cologne area. A further farmstead in Freimersdorf, formerly owned by the Zaun family, is almost identical to Haus Közal.
