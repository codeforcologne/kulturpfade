The first known documentary mention of the Üsdorfer Kapelle dates back to 1466 and names Cologne's _Mariengradenstift_ (St. Maria ad Gradus Endowment) as its owner. After being destroyed, the chapel was rebuilt in 1669 as a simple hall building. Until the 1960s, the church, dedicated to St. Stephen, was integrated into the complex of the now demolished Engelshof. It is planned to incorporate the chapel into a new development and return it to its original use.
