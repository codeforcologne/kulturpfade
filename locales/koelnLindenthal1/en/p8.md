![Odemshof (Lövenich)](./images/koelnLindenthal1/p8.jpg)

An inscription above the gate states the courtyard was restored in 1768 by _Komtur MHE. Detils_. Tradition holds the property was a fiefdom _Lehenshof_ of the Brauweiler Abbey. It is possible, but unconfirmed by documentation, that the Johanniter-Komturei of Cologne was the owner of the estate until secularization. The very impressive, enclosed complex of the Odemshof is one of the large estates of Lövenich. The broadly laid-out late baroque manor house with its curved gables is unique in Cologne. In front of the estate's entrance is a wayside cross from 1862, commemorating the former tenants Krosch-Lemper.
