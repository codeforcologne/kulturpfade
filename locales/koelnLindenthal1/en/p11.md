Only the western parts of the 12th century Romanesque core structure are still preserved. In 1857/58, the Frechen master builder Ernst (?) Weyden constructed the eastern section on the old choir foundations, following plans by Ernst Friedrich Zwirner. Inside, remnants of historical painting are preserved. Thorough renovation work was carried out in 1979/80.
