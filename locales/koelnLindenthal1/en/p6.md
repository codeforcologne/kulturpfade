This Roman family tomb, discovered in 1843, belonged to an as-yet undiscovered estate. It is one of the most elaborate burial sites in the Gallic-Germanic provinces known to date. The burial chamber, originally likely two stories high, was built in the middle of the 2nd century AD. The structure, dug into the ground and constructed of tuff blocks with a sandstone portal, is internally divided by niches on three sides. The original furnishings have been preserved: three marble busts (late 2nd century) and two wicker chairs replicated in limestone. The seasonal sarcophagus (_Jahreszeitensarkophag_) (end of the 3rd century) once stood outside the chamber. In 1844, the superstructure and the guardhouse were constructed according to plans of Cologne Cathedral master builder Ernst Friedrich Zwirner.
