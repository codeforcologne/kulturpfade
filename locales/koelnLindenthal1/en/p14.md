The Liber Valoris (ca. 1274) is the first documentation of a church in Widdersdorf, later incorporated into the Abbey of Brauweiler between 1494 to 1802. The present church structure was built in 1745, a single-nave brick building with a three-sided closed choir and west tower. Original furnishings from the time of construction are preserved inside. Next to the church are the rectory from 1775 and the old village cemetery with tombstones dating back to the 17th century.
