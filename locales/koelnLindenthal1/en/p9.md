From the 14th to the early 19th century, the Mertenshof was owned by the Cologne Johanniter Commandery of St. John and Cordula. The oldest parts of current structure dates back to 1848. Due to the immediate proximity to the church, the large enclosed estate has enormous urban significance and a formative impact on the village center of LÃ¶venich, which has preserved of its rural character.
