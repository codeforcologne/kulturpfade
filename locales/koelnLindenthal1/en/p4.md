According to ancient tradition, the Fronhof was a gift from Empress Helena in 345 A.D. In 1330, the Cologne Gereonsstift was first mentioned as the owner. Throughout the Middle Ages, the estate also served as seat of the court. An inscription dates the mighty baroque complex, which follows the Frankish building style, to the year 1718.

The chapel opposite the main entrance, with its original furnishings, also dates from the 18th century, forming a unique ensemble together with the estate.
