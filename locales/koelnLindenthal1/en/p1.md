Built 1923, the multi-section complex is centered around the main arena, to which Adolf Abel added the still existing brick wing buildings as architectural framing in 1926. These once dominant structures are arranged axially to the main entrance in classicist austerity. In 1973-75, the stadium was rebuilt according to plans by Dyckerhoff & Widmann with a capacity of around 60,000 people.
