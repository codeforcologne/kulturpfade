![St. Marien (alte Weidener Kirche)](./images/koelnLindenthal1/p7.jpg)

Construction of the first parish church in Weiden became necessary in 1927 due to the rapid expansion of the town, which was ecclesiastically served by Lövenich. The design for this church was provided by the architects Böll & Neuhaus. Stylistically, the church is one of the few examples of Expressionist church architecture in Cologne.
