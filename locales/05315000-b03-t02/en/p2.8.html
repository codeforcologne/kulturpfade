<p>Burg Horbell is considered one of the most impressive estates on the
outskirts of Cologne due to its stately size and the abundance of ancient
building substance. The cellar of the current manor belongs to the original
structure, first documented in 1340 as a fief of the cathedral provostry. The
present, once water-barriered complex dates mainly to the 17th and 18th
centuries. In 1713, Gereon Constantin von Scharffenstein, called Pfeil, Lord of
Bell and Benesis, built the manor house adorned with the marital coat of arms
of the Scharffenstein and Hettinger families. The interior features an imposing
baroque staircase and richly stuccoed ceilings. The castle was converted into a
residential complex in 1979.</p>
