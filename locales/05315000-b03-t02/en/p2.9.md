Several remarkable farming estates have been preserved at the end of Dürener Straße, in the former village of Marsdorf. Despite being surrounded by freeway on-ramps and commercial establishments, they still dominate the streetscape. The oldest is the late Baroque Keuschhof (Dürener Straße 446-450) with its manor house dating from 1774. This enclosed estate complex is surrounded by a large park. In front of it is a small chapel from around 1830.

A bit further along the road is an estate built around 1900 (Dürener Straße 456), and an enclosed complex with a chapel facing the street from 1904. Just before the motorway is the Conzen estate, whose manor house faces the street. The estate was built around 1890.
