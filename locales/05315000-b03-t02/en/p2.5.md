The Decksteiner Weiher section of the _Äußere Grüngürtel_(Outer Green Belt) was created in 1926-1929 as part of employment measures for Cologne's unemployed. An urban design by Fritz Schumacher, which envisioned a green area with allotment gardens, sports fields, forest, and meadow areas, along with a subsequent landscape design by Fritz Encke, who planned the dense tree cover, formed the basis for the design executed by Theodor Nußbaum. The elongated, asymmetrical Decksteiner Weiher with its canal-like central section, expansions at both ends, along with the accompanying avenues form the highlight in the sequence of park spaces.
