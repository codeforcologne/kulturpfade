<p> The Komarhof is first mentioned in 1348 as the feudal property of St. Maria
Abbey in the Capitol. The mayor of Cologne Arnold von Siegen made him "a
wonderful manor," an impression that the visitor still gains today. Over the
centuries, the courtyard was built and rebuilt several times, first in 1657,
then according to the inscription 1724, and in the years 1800 and 1812.
Destruction of a significant kind took place during the 2nd World War as well
as in a fire in 1974. Due to its stately size and the manor house with curly
gables, this closed courtyard on the edge of Klettenberg conveys the wealth of
the once numerous courtyards in the Cologne city area particularly clearly.
