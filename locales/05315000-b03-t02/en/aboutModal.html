            Cologne's <i>Kulturpfade</i> (cultural paths) were first developed towards
            the end of the 1970's. They were intended to raise awareness of 
            monument protection in post-war Cologne. The paths were marked by
            markers installed on buildings along the route. These markers described
            the building and settlement history of the respective building and
            provided an overview of neighboring points on the path.
            </p>

            <p>
            The markers were no longer locatable, lost or destroyed. Some were renewed
            and renovated by local district associations in the 2010s. Although there
            were some publications on the cultural paths, knowledge about them is now
            only fragmentary.

            <p> This project of the OK Lab Cologne in collaboration with the city of Cologne aims to 
            reserve the surving sources and make them accessible by developing a <i>Kulturpfade</i> 
            application. The application allows users to explore the cultural paths and enable an
            option to update the information with additional data.
