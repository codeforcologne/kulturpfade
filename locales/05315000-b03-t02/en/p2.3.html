<p> These remnants of a pillar belonging to a Roman aquaduct in Berrenrather
Straße (in front of house no. 436) presumably date to the 3rd century A.D. It
was originally located on the opposite side of the street. This more recent water
pipeline carried drinking water over a distance of 77.6 km from the area of
Nettersheim in the High Eifel to Roman Cologne. This water pipeline is
considered one of the greatest achievements of Roman engineering in Germany.
