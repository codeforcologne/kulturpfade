<p> Probably from the 3rd Century, the pillar remains of the Roman water pipe
in Berrenrather Straße (in front of house no. 436). The original location was
on the opposite side of the road. Via this younger water pipe, drinking water
was led over a distance of 77.6 km from the area of Nettersheim in the
Hocheifel to the Roman Cologne. This water pipe is considered one of the
greatest achievements of Roman engineering in Germany. </p>
