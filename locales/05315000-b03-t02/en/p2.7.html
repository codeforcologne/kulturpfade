<p> The first plausibel mention of the estate as "villa Stute" is in a document
dating to 1271 from the Teutonic Order Commandery of St. Catharina in Cologne.
Ownership of the estate passed to the Cologne patrician Johann von Spiegel zum
Irrgang though marriage in 1336. As late as 1688, the estate was still referred
to as a knight's fief. An inscription dates the current buildings of the
enclosed estate to 1868. It is particularly noteworthy that parts of the old
moat system of the once water-defended farmstead have been preserved.</p>
