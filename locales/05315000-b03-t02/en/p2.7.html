<p> Probably as a "villa mare", the court is mentioned for the first time in
1271 in a document of the German Order St. Catharina in Cologne. In 1336, the
Cologne patrician Johann von Spiegel becomes the owner of the estate by
marriage. In 1688, the court is still referred to as a knight's fief. According
to the inscription, the current buildings of the closed courtyard were built in
1868. It is noteworthy that in part the old trench system of the once
water-embarred courtyard has still been preserved. </p>
