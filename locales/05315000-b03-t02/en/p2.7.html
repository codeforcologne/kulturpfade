    Probably as a "villa mare", the court is mentioned for the first time in 1271 in a document of the German Order St. Catharina in Cologne. In 1336, the Cologne patrician Johann von Spiegel becomes the owner of the estate by marriage. In 1688, the court is still referred to as a knight's fief. According to the inscription, the current buildings of the closed courtyard were built in 1868. It is noteworthy that in part the old trench system of the once water-embarred courtyard has still been preserved.
