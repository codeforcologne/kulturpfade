<p> Several remarkable farming estates have been preserved at the end of
Dürener Straße, in the former village of Marsdorf. Despite being surrounded by
freeway on-ramps and commercial establishments, they still dominate the
streetscape. The oldest is the late Baroque Keuschhof (Dürener Straße 446-450)
with its manor house dating from 1774. This enclosed estate complex is
surrounded by a large park. In front of it is a small chapel from around 1830.

<p> A bit further along the road is an estate built around 1900 (Dürener Straße
456), and an enclosed complex with a chapel facing the street from 1904. Just
before the motorway is the Conzen estate, whose manor house faces the street.
The estate was built around 1890. </p>
