<p> At the end of Dürener Straße, some remarkable courtyards have still been
preserved in the former village of Marsdorf, which, narrowed by motorway
entrances and commercial enterprises, still determine the streetscape. The
oldest structural complex is the late Baroque Keuschhof (Dürener Straße
446-450) with its manor house from 1774. The closed courtyard complex is
surrounded by a large park. In front of a saint's house of approx. 1830. </p>

<p> A little further a manor built around 1900 (Dürener Straße 456), a closed
courtyard complex with a chapel on the street from 1904. Shortly before the
motorway is the Conzen estate, whose mansion has its side of the street. The
farm was built around 1890. </p>
