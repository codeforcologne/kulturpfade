![Fort VI](./images/05315000-b03-t02/p2.6.jpg)

Fort VI was built between 1873 and 1876 as part of an outer fortifications ring around the city of Cologne. Following the demolition of the fortifications in accordance to the Treaty of Versailles, only the city-facing barracks and parts of the lateral flanking trenches remained of the large fortification. During the incorporation of the fortification grounds into the _Äußeren Grüngürtels_ parkscape between 1923 and 1927, the ground floor of the barracks, located in the trench, disappeared after the surrounding ground level was raised to the upper floor. Fritz Encke created a rock garden in the recreational area on the northern side of the trench. Encke derived the path layout and terrain formation from the fort's original ground plan. The fort was extended in 1980-82.
