<p> The Decksteiner Weiher section of the <i>Äußere Grüngürtel</i>(Outer Green
Belt) was created in 1926-1929 as part of employment measures for Cologne's
unemployed. An urban design by Fritz Schumacher, which envisioned a green area
with allotment gardens, sports fields, forest, and meadow areas, along with a
subsequent landscape design by Fritz Encke, who planned the dense tree cover,
formed the basis for the design executed by Theodor Nußbaum. The elongated,
asymmetrical Decksteiner Weiher with its canal-like central section, expansions
at both ends, along with the accompanying avenues form the highlight in the
sequence of park spaces. </p>
