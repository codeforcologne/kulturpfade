<p> The outer green belt in the Decksteiner Weiher section was created in
1926-1929 as part of employment measures for the Cologne unemployed. An urban
design by Fritz Schumacher, who had generally provided for a green area with
allotments, sports, forest and meadow areas, as well as a subsequent
horticultural design by Fritz Encke, who had planned a relatively dense tree
growth, formed the basis for the executed design by Theodor Nußbaum. The
elongated, in the floor plot asymmetrical Decksteiner Weiher with the
canal-like centrepiece and the extensions at both ends as well as the
accompanying avenues forms the design highlight in the sequence of different
green spaces. </p>
