    The outer green belt in the Decksteiner Weiher section was created in 1926-1929 as part of employment measures for the Cologne unemployed. An urban design by Fritz Schumacher, who had generally provided for a green area with allotments, sports, forest and meadow areas, as well as a subsequent horticultural design by Fritz Encke, who had planned a relatively dense tree growth, formed the basis for the executed design by Theodor Nußbaum. The elongated, in the floor plot asymmetrical Decksteiner Weiher with the canal-like centrepiece and the extensions at both ends as well as the accompanying avenues forms the design highlight in the sequence of different green spaces.
