These remnants of a pillar belonging to a Roman aquaduct in Berrenrather Straße (in front of house no. 436) presumably date to the 3rd century A.D. It was originally located on the opposite side of the street. This more recent water pipeline carried drinking water over a distance of 77.6 km from the area of Nettersheim in the High Eifel to Roman Cologne. This water pipeline is considered one of the greatest achievements of Roman engineering in Germany.
