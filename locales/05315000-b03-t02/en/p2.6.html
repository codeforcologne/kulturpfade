<p> Fort VI was built in the course of creating an outer fortress belt around
the city of Cologne in 1873-76. After the grinding of the fortifications in
accordance with the demands of the Versailles Treaty, only the city-side larynx
barracks and parts of the lateral flank trenches remained of the large
fortification. When the fortress site was included in the park landscape of the
Outer Green Belt, 1923-27, the ground floor of the throat barracks in the ditch
disappeared by raising the ground level to the upper floor. In the recreation
facility created according to the design of Fritz Encke, a rock garden was
created in the northern side ditch. The route guidance and terrain formation
derived Encke from the ground structure of the fort. 1980-82 the fort received
superstructures. </p>
