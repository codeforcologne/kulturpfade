<p> Fort VI was built between 1873 and 1876 as part of an outer fortifications
ring around the city of Cologne. Following the demolition of the fortifications
in accordance to the Treaty of Versailles, only the city-facing barracks and
parts of the lateral flanking trenches remained of the large fortification.
During the incorporation of the fortification grounds into the <i>Äußeren
Grüngürtels</i> parkscape between 1923 and 1927, the ground floor of the
barracks, located in the trench, disappeared after the surrounding ground level
was raised to the upper floor. Fritz Encke created a rock garden in the
recreational area on the northern side of the trench. Encke derived the path
layout and terrain formation from the fort's original ground plan. The fort was
extended in 1980-82.</p>
