<p> The Klettenbergpark, designed in 1905/06 according to the design of garden
director Fritz Encke, was built instead of a sand and gravel pit up to 10 m
deep. The remodelling of this pit resulted from a simultaneous construction
project of a construction company to open up the environment with a country
house development. In the park, in the middle of which a pond fed by the
Duffesbach was created, the walker should be able to get to know various
Rhenish landscape sections in the form of a sequence of corresponding
vegetation images (forest, meadow and shore parts) as well as typical rock
formations (basalt and shale quarry) and observe their seasonal changes. </p>
