Klettenbergpark, laid out in 1905/06 according to a design by garden director Fritz Encke, was created in place of a sand and gravel pit which was up to 10 meters deep. The transformation of the pit was the result of a contemporary construction project by a building company wanting to promote the surrounding area as a: country house development. Centerpiece of the park is a pond fed by the Duffesbach stream. The park was designed to allow visitors to explore Rhineland landscapes through varying vegetation (forests, meadows and bank areas) as well as typical rock formations (basalt and slate quarry) and observe seasonal changes.
