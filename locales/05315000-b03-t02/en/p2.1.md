The Komarhof is first mentioned in 1348 as feudal property of _St. Maria im Kapitol_ (St. Mary's in the Capitol). Around 1550, the mayor of Cologne, Arnold von Siegen, converted the property into "a magnificent knight's estate", an impression which remains to this day. Over the ensuing centuries, the estate was built and rebuilt several times: first in 1657, then according to an inscription in 1724, as well as in 1800 and 1812. WWII resulted in significant damage, as did a fire in 1974. The Komarhof on the edge of Klettenberg, with its stately size and manor house with curved gables, clearly conveys the wealth of the once numerous estates in the Cologne city area.
