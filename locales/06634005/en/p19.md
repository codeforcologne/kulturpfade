![Haus Drissel](./images/06634005/p19.jpg)

Built in 1588, the house is a typical example of Renaissance architecture. The facade features the characteristic carved decorations of this architectural and cultural style, especially the twisted rope on the cornices. The house was owned for decades by the Catholic priestly family Drissel. In 1979/80, it was extensively renovated by the Schlotthauer family.
