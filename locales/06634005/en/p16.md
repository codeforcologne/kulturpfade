Around 1310, gabled houses were built by patrician families in Fritzlar using the expensive stone construction method of the Middle Ages. The exterior walls are up to 1.20 meters thick. Around 1700, the originally steeper roofs were removed, and the high rectangular ends of the gables were shortened. After 1900, the street facade at Kasseler Straße 6 was remodeled. Between 1986 and 1988, Kasseler Straße 8 underwent extensive renovation.
