The dating of the preserved original half-timbered beams indicates that the building was constructed after 1416. The structure is a multi-story building with cantilevered floors on brackets. In the rear, non-visible walls, the older post-and-beam construction is still preserved. The building was extensively renovated by the city of Stattarchis in 1988/89 and has since been the seat of the city archive and the tourist information office.
