Built in the second half of the 16th century, the building features a post-and-beam construction on the ground floor and in the overlying mezzanine floor. These mezzanine floors were often integrated into the originally high hall floors. The building served as a residential and economic structure with a rear house and barns or stables. The layout of the front house was designed to allow passage for livestock and small carts.
