Built around 1470, the Gothic building is an early example of half-timbered construction in post-and-beam style. The upper floor is cantilevered and decorated with St. Andrew's crosses. The front door dates back to the time of the house's construction. It is one of the oldest half-timbered houses in the city. It was likely originally a craftsmanâ€™s house (bell founder) and later also a merchant's house. The pointed arch office or sales window is a reminder of its former use. The rear house, a pure post-and-beam structure, was built around 1480.
