<p>As a radial green connection between the two concentric green spaces created on the former fortress site, the outer and inner green belt, a representative complex was created in 1925 according to the design of Fritz Schumacher, which is formally borrowed from baroque models. In the design, Konrad Adenauer's desire to own something like the Königsallee in Cologne in Cologne may also have spoken out. The starting point of the green train with canal system is the Aachener Weiher, the design highlight of the Inner Green Belt, from which the complex, up to the interruption at Karl-Schwering-Platz, leads to the city forest.</p>
