<p>In 1810, the cemetery Melaten (malade = sick) was opened as a Catholic central cemetery on the site of the former leper house, from which the chapel is still preserved. The planning comes from Ferdinand Franz Wallraf and Maximilian Weyhe. Von Wallraf is also the Latin inscription on the classicist portico, which reads in the translation: "A sacred place for the dead of Cologne. Greetings to a better future sown seeds. Don't pass by without prayers, you, soon the one of us." Since 1829, this cemetery, which is an important document of the city's history as well as the tomb art of the 19th and 20th centuries, has been a part of this cemetery. Century, accessible to all denominations. The old chapel of the Leprosen-haus is also integrated into the strictly geometric planning of the cemetery on Aachener Straße. A first construction was probably already standing here towards the end of the 12th century. Century, a chapel of St. Dionysius, however, only for the year 1245. Today's chapel, which was in the 19th Century rebuilt several times and in the 2nd World War was severely destroyed, dates back to 1474.</p>
