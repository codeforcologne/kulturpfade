A technical architectural monument of a rare kind is the fire station built in 1914-17 in Gleueler Stra√üe, whose architect was Baurat Klewitz. In addition to equipment and wagon halls as well as offices, the building also has apartments. The tower once had its function as a reporting tower. For today's viewer, the artistic-creative effort of architecture may seem unusual, for the construction period it was a matter of course. The factory stone reliefs above the portals refer to the use of the fire brigade.
