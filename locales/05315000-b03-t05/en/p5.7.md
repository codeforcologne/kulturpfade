In Theresienstra√üe, the villa development of the time around 1900, which was once characteristic of Lindenthal, has still been preserved in some parts. Stucco and stucco-decorated villas and half villas shaped the suburb until the Second World War and gave it the reputation of an elegant, strongly green district.
