<p>From the Catholic parish church of St. Stephan, built in 1884-86 according to designs by August Lange, only the neo-Gothic tower was preserved by the war. Joachim Sch√ºrmann integrated it into the new building complex in 1960 as a free-standing camper. The actual church, a cubic steel glass building with brick walls in the lower area, is supposed to symbolize the "heavenly Jerusalem" as a "glass sea" by alternating from silvery translucent and opaque glass panes.</p>
