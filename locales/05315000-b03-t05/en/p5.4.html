<p>The Catholic parish church, built after Entwürten by Gotfried Böhm in 1967-70, forms the western viewpoint in the axis of the Lindenthaler Kanal from the Aachener Weiher. The multi-graded and beveled building is reminiscent of expressionist architectural projects of the 1920s in its crystalline concept. Mostly only brick and concrete were used as material. The interior, also designed by Böhm, is illuminated by windows in gray-red tones.</p>
