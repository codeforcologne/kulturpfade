The Jewish community in Moers was first mentioned in 1613; in 1818, it acquired two houses in the old town, one of which served as a synagogue. After the Reich Pogrom Night in 1938, the synagogue was destroyed and later used for secular purposes before being demolished in 1975. Since 1987, a replica of the entrance arch with the inscription “Open for me the gates of righteousness” commemorates the former synagogue; the inner sides bear the names of the 180 Moers victims of the Shoah. Every year on November 9th, a memorial service is held here to commemorate the Reich Pogrom Night.
