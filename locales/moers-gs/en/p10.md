The Protestant teacher training seminar was established in Moers in 1820 as the third of its kind in the Rhine Province, with Adolph Diesterweg as its first director. From 1823, it was housed in a neoclassical building previously constructed by Senior Bailiff Matthias Scheidtmann. The seminar offered comprehensive training in subjects such as language, mathematics, religion, natural history, history, geography, pedagogy, didactics, drawing, writing, and music, supplemented by practical instruction in gardening and fruit tree cultivation. Diesterweg made Moers a center for the reform of elementary education for twelve years before being called to Berlin in 1832; he was succeeded by Franz Ludwig Zahn.
