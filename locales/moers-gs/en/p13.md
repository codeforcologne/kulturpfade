In the Middle Ages, the site of today’s Neumarkt was occupied by the “Meer,” a dammed section of the Moers river that separated the Old Town from the New Town. In addition to this water trench, walls and towers protected both parts of the city, connected by a bridge. With the construction of new fortifications under Maurice of Orange between 1601 and 1620, the “Meer” lost its significance and was partially filled in by 1639, creating space for gardens and pathways. In 1664, the central part of the city moat was vaulted over, laying the foundation for today’s Neumarkt; the nearby “Meertor” remained a city landmark until its demolition in 1907.
