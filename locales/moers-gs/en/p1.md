The Altmarkt in Moers has been the center of the city since the Middle Ages, located at the intersection of important roads, such as the route from the castle to the parish church outside the city and the Steinstraße, the only continuous east-west connection. After Moers was granted town status in 1300, the square developed further: in 1415, meat stalls were mentioned, around 1460, a merchant house that likely served as the first town hall, and in the 1440s, Count Friedrich III of Moers had a representative house built at the corner of Steinstraße and Klosterstraße, now known as the Löwen-Apotheke. In 1633, the city acquired land on the north side of the Altmarkt for the city scales, and in 1773, the Adler-Apotheke, the oldest pharmacy in Moers, received its exclusive privilege. The monument by sculptor Adam Rützel has commemorated King Friedrich Wilhelm IV’s visit in 1852 since 1859, marking the 150th anniversary of the County of Moers becoming part of Prussia.
