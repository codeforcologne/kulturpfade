The oldest settlement of Moers was first mentioned around the year 900 in the property register of Werden Abbey and comprised five and a half manses, which belonged to the manor association of Friemersheim. A manse was a medieval farmstead with enough land to support a family. Initially, Moers was a small rural settlement by the Moerse River, probably with a church dedicated to Saint Boniface. Later, around 1200, a new settlement emerged near the castle of the Counts of Moers, which was granted town rights in 1300 and fortified in the 14th century, while the original parish church remained outside the city walls.
