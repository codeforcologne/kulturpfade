After World War I, Moers remained a stronghold of the Kaiser’s loyalists, with up to 82% voting for the Hitler coalition in some districts during the 1932 Reichstag election. In 1939, 30,000 people celebrated the inauguration of the strategically important Rheinpreußen fuel plant in Meerbeck. From 1943 onwards, intensified air raids primarily targeted areas between the fuel plant and the train station, with approximately 150 round bunkers, known as the “Moerser Töpfe,” providing shelter. On March 4, 1945, Moers was liberated by U.S. troops; there were a total of 150 bombing victims, 975 fallen soldiers, and 182 Moers Jews as well as at least 930 forced laborers in the Moers district lost their lives.
