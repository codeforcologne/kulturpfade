In 1857, the district of Moers was formed from parts of the district of Geldern, becoming the largest Prussian county with 565 square kilometers; the first district administrator was Adolf Ernst von Ernsthausen. At that time, the Protestant-influenced town of Moers had about 3,300 inhabitants, while the new district had 59,000 residents, with around half of the population engaged in agriculture. Due to the left-bank coal boom, the districtâ€™s population increased to 107,000 by 1905, leading to significant industrial developments such as the Krupp ironworks in Rheinhausen (1898) and the Sachtleben paint factory in Homberg (1899). On January 1, 1975, Moers lost its district seat when the municipal reorganization created the district of Wesel, and the district administration was moved to Wesel.
