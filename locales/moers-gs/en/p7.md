Founded on March 15, 1843, the “Private Institution for the Mentally Ill in Moers” was the first private asylum in the Rhine Province, initiated by Dr. med. Johannes Heinrich Wittfeld, who believed that small private institutions provided better care for mentally ill patients. Using his own funds, he had a simple hospital built in 1841/42 in a 5½-acre garden on the southern side of the city, featuring twelve sleeping chambers and common rooms for men and women. In 1850, Wittfeld expanded the facility with a dining hall and a bowling alley under a glass roof, reflecting early approaches to occupational therapy. After Wittfeld’s death, the institution changed hands several times, was closed in 1859, and the residential building, now known as the “White House,” is under monument protection.
