The present park landscape with its water features and islands is a remnant of the fortifications that Maurice of Orange had built at the beginning of the 17th century to replace the outdated defenses. The new construction, designed by Simon Stevin, followed the Dutch fortress type, with ramparts made of local earth and wide water-filled moats fed by the Moerse, which increased the distance to the attacker and provided the defender with a favorable field of fire. Elandts’ plan from 1663 shows the state after completion and illustrates how strongly today’s landscape is shaped by the former military installations, with the contours of the fortress moat and the two islands recognizable as former outworks. After the dismantling of the fortress in 1763 under Frederick II, the inner defensive structures were leveled, the earth masses filled into the moats, creating new land areas that today form the core of the castle park, while the preserved glacis serves as a promenade with an avenue, forming the urban framework of the fortress city of Moers.
