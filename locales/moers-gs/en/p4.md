Moers Castle, one of the oldest preserved high medieval ring fortresses in the Rhineland, was built by the Lords of Moers in the 12th or 13th century as a residential tower made of tuff stone in the lowlands of the Moerse. Under Count Friedrich III, the castle was secured with an outer bailey and reached its greatest significance. After the county was taken over by Maurice of Orange in 1601, a larger fortress with five bastions was built around the castle and the town, which was dismantled in 1763/64. In the 19th century, the industrialist Friedrich Wintgens acquired the estate, extended the western part, and created the castle park; in 1905, the city of Moers purchased the castle and, after renovations, opened the Grafschafter Museum in 1908.
