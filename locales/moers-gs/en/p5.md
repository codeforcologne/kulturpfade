After the introduction of the Reformation in 1560, only a few Catholics lived in Moers until the early 18th century, mainly garrison members and some immigrants. With the influx of former French soldiers, craftsmen, and laborers during the Seven Yearsâ€™ War, the Catholic community grew to about 50 members. In 1771, King Frederick II permitted a collection for the construction of a Catholic church, whose foundation stone was laid in 1778 and consecrated a year later; today, this early classical building serves as a kindergarten. Due to the growth of the congregation, the present Catholic parish church of St. Josef was built between 1868 and 1871, a three-nave neo-Gothic brick basilica with a three-apse termination and west tower.
